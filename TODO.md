# TODO

- Solve bug where if the user chooses to build "All" files (on the source file selection prompt), the timer gets compromised and gives an error (asynchrony bug/feature);

- Debug and solve the reason for the addition of "﻿" (whitespace?) symbols (char encoding issue?). No interpreter errors though;

- Add support for only typing the directory name to merge all its files (without any specific order);

- TESTS;
- Add an edit source file command to the CLI;
- Add more validation and error handling to the CLI.
