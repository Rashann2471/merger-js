# TODO:

- Solve bug where, if the user passes an unknown configuration key to the "merger set" command, the error gets thrown but the key is added to the configuration file;
- Add the source file paths, not only the file names, to the source file build selection;
- Remove the last if from selectSourceFilePrompt.js;
- Redo the CLI's merger set command Key logic (minify, mnfy, autobuild, etc.) with a switch statement;
- Add remove (source file) command to the CLI;
- Add more validation and error handling to the CLI.
