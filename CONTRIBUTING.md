## Asking Questions

If you have a question, first try to find an answer on the [Issues](https://github.com/joao-neves95/merger-js/issues).
If you do not find any, create a new issue with the tag `question`.

## Reporting Issues/Bugs

If you identify a bug, before creating a new issue, check if a similiar one already exists.

If you find it, use comments and reactions (upvote/downvote) to convey your stand on the matter.

If you do not find an existing one, [create a new issue](https://github.com/joao-neves95/merger-js/issues/new) using one of the templates.

## Pull Requests

Before making a pull request, create a new issue about the feature/bug, or comment on an existing one, and state your 
intent about working on it.

Use the [style guide](https://github.com/joao-neves95/merger-js/blob/master/STYLE-GUIDE.md).

Do not make breaking changes.
